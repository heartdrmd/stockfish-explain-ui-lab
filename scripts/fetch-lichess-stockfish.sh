# fetch-lichess-stockfish.sh — download lichess's pre-built stockfish-web
# binary + the official Stockfish NNUE files.
#
# Why: building Stockfish WASM with fast-load flags (NNUE_EMBEDDING_OFF,
# MINIMAL_RUNTIME, wasm-opt, brotli) requires a full emscripten pipeline.
# Lichess already does it, publishes via npm, and downloads the same
# NNUEs at runtime. Vendoring their package is 1 step vs a multi-hour
# build pipeline.
#
# Produces:
#   assets/stockfish-web/sf_18.js, sf_18.wasm, (others)
#   assets/nnue/small.nnue   — current official smallnet (~6 MB)
#   assets/nnue/big.nnue     — current official bignet   (~75 MB)
#
# Idempotent — skips files already present.
